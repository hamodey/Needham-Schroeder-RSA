# READ ME IMPORTANT 

## Group:
Ahmed Al-waili, Mahmudul Fakrul, Taha Zachoni

### To make program run:

`java gui.menu` in the directory `/out/production/menu` 

This program was written in IntelliJ with a Java Package, as we have created Methods for the RSA and this is NOT hard coded, as this is adaptable, that is the reason for a package. We have made Dr Ida Pu aware through email and she has asked us to notify the marker via a README file or comment.
